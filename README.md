## imageDetect.py: 
Utilizing different object detection methods, starting with OCR and Pytesseract following this blog post https://varunbpatil.github.io/2018/01/28/OTP-scanner-1.html.

## eastOCR.py: 
Still being debugged but following this tutorial https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/20/opencv-text-detection-east-text-detector/, which utilizes EAST detection and OpenCV.

Successful OCR implementation, and future implementation of Text Recognition of the images
